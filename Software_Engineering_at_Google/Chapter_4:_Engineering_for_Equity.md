Chapter 4: Engineering for Equity
==============


**Equity in software engineering** is about how we approach our products, our team members, and our users.

-   **Diverse teams perform better than homogeneous ones**. When you bring together people with different backgrounds and experiences, you gain broader perspectives and identify more potential issues or improvements in the product.
-   **Not all team members and users have the same starting point**. Within a team, skill levels, communication styles, and experiences vary. Among users, not everyone has the same device capabilities or access to high-end technology. We should address this by providing clear, understandable documentation for the team and ensuring the product works well across all devices and environments.
-   **Collaboration tools and processes build alignment**. Code reviews, meetings, and well-maintained documentation help keep the team aligned, foster inclusivity, and ensure that decisions and knowledge are shared effectively.
