Chapter 3: Knowledge Sharing
==============

Knowledge sharing is an essential part of the job.
When knowledge is trapped in one person's mind, it slows the team down --- and if anything happens to that person, the project can be seriously damaged.

### Types of Knowledge

- **Tacit Knowledge**:
    Hard to share because it's based on personal experience, intuition, and skills.
- **Explicit Knowledge**:
    Clear and well-defined information that can be documented and shared with other team members.

### Documentation and Maintenance

- Documentation can become outdated over time, so it must be regularly reviewed and updated.
- Keep information in a **single source of truth** so team members can find everything they need in one place.

### Knowledge Sharing Methods

- **Asynchronous**:
    Examples include documentation, wikis, and recorded demos.
    Best for long-term reference, such as onboarding new team members or preserving decisions for the future.

- **Synchronous**:
    Examples include team meetings, pair programming, and code reviews.
    Best for improving current work, clarifying details, and collaborating in real time.
