‚úçÔ∏è Summary: Engineering for Research
==========  

-   **Engineering for research** is about connecting two worlds --- **researchers** who focus on innovation and discovery, and **engineers** who build scalable, reliable systems.

-   These two roles have different goals: researchers seek new knowledge, while engineers prioritize stability and maintainability.

-   Successful collaboration happens when both sides work together early --- aligning research ideas with technical feasibility and product goals.

### üß© Key Points

-   **Early collaboration** prevents wasted effort when moving from prototype to production.

-   **Prototypes** focus on speed and flexibility, while **production systems** need reliability, performance, and clean design.

-   Transitioning from one to the other requires refactoring, testing, and strong communication.

-   **Cultural balance** matters: research values creativity and freedom; engineering values structure and predictability. Both are necessary for long-term innovation.

-   Many Google products (like Search, Translate, TensorFlow) grew from tight cooperation between research and engineering teams.
