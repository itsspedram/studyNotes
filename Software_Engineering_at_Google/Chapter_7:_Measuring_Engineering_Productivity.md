‚úçÔ∏è Summary: Measuring Engineering Productivity
==============

-   Measuring productivity in software engineering is complex because output isn't just lines of code --- it's about long-term impact, collaboration, and product quality.

-   **Traditional metrics** (like LOC or commits per day) are misleading and often encourage bad habits.

-   Google's approach is based on **three pillars**:

    1.  **Developer Satisfaction** -- How happy and unblocked engineers feel in their work environment.

    2.  **System Health** -- Efficiency of the engineering process (PR merge time, CI reliability, test flakiness, onboarding speed).

    3.  **Business & User Impact** -- Whether the team's work delivers real value to users or the company.

-   Metrics should be **data-informed**, not data-driven --- they guide human judgment, not replace it.

-   Focus on **team productivity**, not individuals. Collaboration, mentoring, and refactoring matter as much as writing new code.

-   Avoid **metric gaming** --- transparency and context are key to keeping metrics useful and fair.

### üß† Key Takeaway

Good metrics help teams **learn and improve**, not compete.\
True productivity comes from a healthy team, efficient systems, and meaningful impact --- not just speed or numbers.
