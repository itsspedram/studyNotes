Chapter 2: How to Work Well on Teams
==============

**Software engineering is a team effort**. A successful product is the result of contributions from hundreds or even thousands of team members over time.
-   **HRT --- Humility, Respect, and Trust** --- are essential foundations for effective collaboration. Without these values, teams struggle to work together productively.
-   **Psychological safety is critical**. Every team member should feel safe to ask questions, share feedback, and express ideas without fear of judgment or punishment.
-   **Follow communication best practices**. Prioritize clear, written communication---through documentation, comments, and messages. Be concise but never skip context. Avoid ambiguity or passive-aggressive behavior. Document decisions to help current and future team members understand the reasoning behind them.
-   **Cultivate a healthy code review culture**. Reviews should focus on improving the code, not criticizing the person. Avoid being forceful or defensive. Instead, explain the reasoning behind your feedback and treat code reviews as a shared learning opportunity---not a conflict.

üèóÔ∏è Why This Matters in Practice
--------------------------------

-   Projects often fail not due to technical issues, but due to breakdowns in team collaboration.
-   As you scale a product or team, **process and culture** start to matter more than raw coding skill.
-   Practicing HRT and creating psychological safety can 10x a team's effectiveness.
